# Real-time_IoT_Data_Pipeline
The Real-time IoT Data Pipeline project involves building a system that can collect, process, and analyze data from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices as it's generated.  The goal is to create a seamless, end-to-end flow of information, from the sensors to the end-user, with minimal delay. This pipeline must be scalable to handle a large volume of data and flexible enough to integrate with different types of devices and platforms.

## Project Goal: To build a scalable and flexible end-to-end data pipeline for collecting, processing, and analyzing real-time data from various IoT devices with minimal delay.

## key areas of data engineering:

* Data Ingestion: Sourcing data from various IoT devices, which might involve different protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP, CoAP).

* Stream Processing: Handling the continuous flow of data in real-time. Technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, or Apache Spark Streaming could be used here.

* Data Storage: Storing both raw and processed data efficiently. This could involve time-series databases, data lakes, or data warehouses.

* Data Analysis & Visualization: Creating insights from the processed data and presenting them to end-users with minimal latency.
