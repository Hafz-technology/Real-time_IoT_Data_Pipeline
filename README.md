# Real-time_IoT_Data_Pipeline
The Real-time IoT Data Pipeline project involves building a system that can collect, process, and analyze data from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices as it's generated.  The goal is to create a seamless, end-to-end flow of information, from the sensors to the end-user, with minimal delay. This pipeline must be scalable to handle a large volume of data and flexible enough to integrate with different types of devices and platforms.
